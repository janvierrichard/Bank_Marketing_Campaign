# Bank Marketing CampaignðŸ’³ðŸ’°

## ðŸ–‹ About Project:
Bank B, a fictional bank, provides various financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc., to its customers. To increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts marketing campaigns for its financial products like credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc. These campaigns target the bank's existing customers. However, it is crucial for the marketing campaigns to be cost-efficient, aiming not only to increase overall revenues but also total profit.

Specifically, the bank conducted a telemarketing campaign to promote one of its financial products, 'Term Deposits,' with the aim of fostering long-term relationships with existing customers. Bank B also want to know their lifecycle product that can be compared to other products and evaluate their marketing tactics.
